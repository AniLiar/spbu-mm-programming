Robin the Bobbin.
the big-bellied Ben,
He ate more meat
than fourscore men;
He ate a cow,
he ate a calf,
He ate a butcher
and a half,
He ate a church,
he ate a steeple,
He ate a priest
and all the people!
A cow and a calf,
An ox and a half,
A church and a steeple,
And all good people,
And yet he complained
that his stomach wasn't full.
